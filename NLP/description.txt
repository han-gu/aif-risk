Right now, this is the first iteration of the model. We only have data points from APPL but looking forward we want to:
* Add regex to be compatible with more 10-ks
* Scrape the dates the 10-k was filed
* Scrape price from Yahoo Finance using those deights
* Weight the changes 
    * Sentiment analysis
* Get more data points with all tickers

In order to get to the plot:

1)run get_10k.py
2)run parse_sections.py
3)run sentence_matcher.py
4)run get_price_changes.py
